# Node TypeScript Recursive File Parsing

The script takes a folder with TypeScript files as an input (in our case it is "input-files" folder) 
and creates a file ("output/all-exports.ts") with all exports aggregated in it.

* run script `npm start`
* open output/all-exports.ts to see the result

```typescript
// This file is generated by collect-exports.ts script, do not edit it manually!
import { bbbbb } from "../input-files/constants";
import { Cat } from "../input-files/classes/Cat";
import { Dog } from "../input-files/classes/Dog";
import { Dog2 } from "../input-files/classes/Dog";
import { EColor } from "../input-files/enum/EColor";
import { calcDistance } from "../input-files/functions/arrow-function";
import { sum } from "../input-files/functions/classic-function";

const MyLib = {
  bbbbb,
  Cat,
  Dog,
  Dog2,
  EColor,
  calcDistance,
  sum,
}
export default MyLib;

```
